# Animister

![Project Image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vergarapog/animista-clone-ts/main/public/git-pic/animista-clone-sc.jpg)

This project is a faithful clone of the Animista.net website. It demonstrates my web development and design skills by replicating Animista's user-friendly interface for generating CSS animations. The clone closely mimics the responsive design and animation features of the original website, focusing on the principles of UI/UX. I've even added  features like tailwind code generation support and the ability to drag the animated object for further experimentation.

## Features

- **Animation Presets**: Animista offers a wide range of pre-built animation presets, categorized by type, such as entrance, exit, attention seekers, and more. Users can select from these presets as a starting point for their animations.
- **Customization**: You can customize and fine-tune the animations by adjusting various parameters, such as animation duration, timing function, delay, iteration count, and more.
- **Preview**: Animista provides a live preview of the animations you are creating, allowing you to see how the animation will look in real-time as you make changes.
- **CSS Code Generation**: After customizing an animation, Animista generates the corresponding CSS code for you to copy and paste into your HTML or CSS files.
- **Export Options**: You can choose to export your animations as CSS syntax or Tailwind syntax, depending on your project's requirements.
- **Cross-Browser Compatibility**: The generated CSS code aims to be compatible with different web browsers, ensuring that your animations work consistently across browsers.

## Features to Implement
- Implement an automatic object selection feature in the app, which intelligently identifies the optimal object based on the chosen animations. For example, selecting animations from the "Attention" category will automatically adjust the object to buttons, while choosing animations from the "Background" category will switch the object to cover images.
